<p>
PHP REPL is an <em>experimental</em> website 
for coding php using just a web browser.
Since this is still experimental, do not rely
on the website for earth-shattering situations.
<p>
Use for educational purposes only. As a matter of fact, 
I created this website to further learn and explore
PHP programming.
<p>
The source code is available at 
<a href="https://github.com/nvlled/phprepl">github</a>
if anyone cares.
